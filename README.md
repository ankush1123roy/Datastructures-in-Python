Datastructures-in-Python-
=========================

Different datastructures are implemented in Python. References are used 
and not pointers. References are pointer equivalent in python 
The datastructures are

1. STACK
2. QUEUE
3. LINKED LIST 
4. DOUBLY LINKED LISt
5. BINARY SEARCH TREE

I will adding more of them as I code up more data structures
Some problems (easy)  are also done
